# ðŸ“º Netflix Content Analysis & Recommendation System

This project explores the Netflix dataset (as of 2019) sourced from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. It aims to understand content trends, perform clustering, and build a content-based recommendation engine using text similarity.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Project Summary

In 2018, Flixable reported that the number of TV shows on Netflix had tripled since 2010, while the movie catalog shrank by over 2,000 titles. This project attempts to:

- Explore and analyze this shift in focus.
- Understand the nature of content across countries.
- Cluster similar content based on title/description features.
- Build a basic recommendation system using cosine similarity.

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Netflix has rapidly evolved its catalog over the years. Understanding how content has shifted (movies vs. TV shows), what's available across countries, and how to find similar content can offer strong business insights.  

Key goals include:

- Perform EDA following the **UBM Rule** (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis).
- Cluster similar shows/movies using NLP techniques.
- Create a scalable and production-grade recommendation model.
- Generate insights that can potentially support **positive business decisions**.
